# Tile Gen
A simple Java project for generating tile variants for bit-masking.

**Raw image**: <br>
![Example](assets/example.png) <br>
**Processed image**: <br>
![Example-Tiled](assets/example-tiled.png) <br>

### Using the Generator
- Grab the `TileGen.jar` file. You can either grab this from [releases](https://github.com/GlennFolker/TileGen/releases) or you can also compile this project yourself.
- Create your sprite:
  - The dimension size must be divisible by 4 and must be square.
  - Pixel scaling should be 1Ã—1.
- Run `java -jar TileGen.jar [your-sprite].png`. This will generate a new processed sprite with the name as your raw sprite name suffixed with `-tiled`.

### Using the Processed Sprite
- Split your sprites into `sprites[47]` and map it as shown below: <br>
  ![Tile-Mapping](assets/example-tiled-mapping.png)
- Count the mask by using `mask |= 1 << index`; treat `index` as: <br>
  ![Mask-Index](assets/mask-index.png)
- The sprite of the tile can be mapped from the `mask` by using `sprites[tiles[mask]]` assuming `tiles` is:
